# Chapter 5 · Matching, Flows & Hall

*A lecture course in the spirit of the earlier chapters: the idea before the formula, the story before the proof, and the proof as a conversation. Every method of the reference canon is preserved inside the narrative. The chapter's spine is one algorithmic idea — **augment until stuck, then read the stuck state as a certificate** — and a family of theorems that all say the same thing: the best you can do equals the least you must pay.*

## How to read this chapter

Read it slowly, with a pencil. The problems look like personnel work — marry applicants to positions, send each committee its own delegate, push freight through a network — but they are secretly *accounting* problems. The proofs here rarely construct anything directly; instead they push a procedure until it can no longer move, then interrogate the obstruction. The obstruction always turns out to be a witness that nothing better was possible. That is the aesthetic of the whole subject: **the algorithm's failure mode is the theorem's tightness.**

**Notation.** A bipartite graph has parts X (applicants) and Y (positions), edge xy meaning "x is qualified for y". A **matching** is a set of edges no two of which share a vertex; it **saturates** X if every x ∈ X is matched. N(S) is the set of neighbors of S; ν(G) is the maximum matching size, τ(G) the minimum vertex cover size, α(G) the maximum independent set size. In networks: capacities c, a flow f with value |f|, an s–t cut (S, V∖S) with capacity c(S, V∖S).

**The exercises are graded:** ●○○ *easy* (a direct application of one lecture idea), ●●○ *moderate* (two ideas, or one tricky step), ●●● *tough* (several chapter ideas combined). Hints travel with the problems; worked answers sit at the very end of the chapter. Try honestly before reading a hint. Beyond the graded set, ◆ **pattern-unknown** problems name no method and carry no hint: diagnosing which tool fits is part of the problem. And ◐ **Explorations** at the end are open-ended investigations with no single right answer — research training, not test preparation.

## Lecture 1 · The Matchmaker's Theorem

A matchmaker has applicants X and positions Y. Each applicant is qualified for some subset of the positions. She wants to place **everyone** — each applicant in a distinct position they are qualified for. When can she?

The obvious obstruction: if k applicants are jointly qualified for fewer than k positions, they cannot all be placed — k people cannot sit in fewer than k chairs. Call S ⊆ X any set of applicants and N(S) the positions they are collectively qualified for. The obstruction says: some S with |N(S)| < |S|. **Hall's Marriage Theorem** (1935) says this obvious obstruction is the *only* one:

**Theorem.** A matching saturating X exists **if and only if** every S ⊆ X has |N(S)| ≥ |S|.

The necessity direction is the observation above (a matching pairs S into distinct members of N(S)). The miracle is sufficiency — and the proof below is worth memorizing not for the theorem but for the *architecture*: it is the master example of an induction that would naively die, and is saved by splitting into regimes.

### 1.1 The induction that almost works — and its two rescue regimes

Try induction on |X| the naive way: marry one applicant x to one position y, delete both, and appeal to induction on the rest. The catch: deleting y may *wound* someone else. Applicant x' might have been qualified only for y; the reduced graph no longer satisfies Hall's condition, and the induction hypothesis refuses to load.

✎ **Checkpoint.** Before reading on: find a tiny example where marrying x to y ruins the Hall condition for the survivors. (One applicant qualified only for y does it.) Then ask: what extra property would make the greedy marriage safe?

There are exactly two ways the greedy step can be safe, and together they cover everything.

**Regime 1 — slack everywhere.** Suppose every nonempty proper S ⊊ X has |N(S)| ≥ |S| + 1: there is a spare position in every neighborhood. Marry x to **any** neighbor y. For T ⊆ X − {x}, its neighborhood in the reduced graph is N(T) − {y} at worst: |N′(T)| ≥ |N(T)| − 1 ≥ |T| + 1 − 1 = |T|. Hall survives the deletion; induction finishes. ✓

**Regime 2 — a tight set exists.** Suppose some nonempty proper S has |N(S)| = |S| exactly — a perfectly tight block of applicants and positions. Then split the problem in two, and note that *the split is clean*:
- Match S into N(S) by induction. Hall's condition holds inside: for T ⊆ S, its neighborhood within N(S) is N(T) itself (T ⊆ S forces N(T) ⊆ N(S)), so |N(T) ∩ N(S)| = |N(T)| ≥ |T|. ✓
- Match X − S into Y − N(S) by induction. For T ⊆ X − S, use Hall for T ∪ S in the **original** graph: the neighbors of T outside N(S) number at least |N(T ∪ S)| − |N(S)| ≥ |T ∪ S| − |S| = |T|. ✓
- The two matchings use disjoint vertices (S ∪ N(S) versus its complement); their union saturates X. ∎

If neither regime holds — no nonempty proper S is tight and none has slack — the case cannot actually occur: Hall's inequalities are integer-valued, so for every nonempty proper S with |N(S)| ≥ |S|, exactly one of |N(S)| ≥ |S| + 1 (slack, Regime 1) or |N(S)| = |S| (tight, Regime 2) holds. The two regimes exhaust all cases (with |X| ≤ 1 as the trivial base). **Hall's theorem is proved.** (Pattern **P4**: the critical-set split — *tight somewhere ⇒ solve both halves recursively; slack everywhere ⇒ greed is safe* — reappears in matroid theory, in the Gallai–Edmonds structure theorem, and wherever a min–max theorem hides inside an induction.)

### 1.2 The deficiency form — how many *can* you place?

Hall is all-or-nothing. The refined question: if Hall fails, how many applicants can still be placed? Define the **deficiency** of S as |S| − |N(S)| and let d = max over all S of the deficiency (at least 0, achieved by S = ∅).

**Theorem (deficiency form).** The maximum number of X-vertices that can be simultaneously matched is exactly |X| − d.

*Two directions, and the hard one is sneaky-easy.* **No matching beats |X| − d:** take S* with deficiency d. Any matching places the members of S* into distinct members of N(S*) — at most |N(S*)| = |S*| − d of them — so at least d applicants of S* go unplaced. **Some matching achieves |X| − d:** add d **dummy positions**, each acceptable to *every* applicant. The padded graph satisfies Hall: for any S ⊆ X, its padded neighborhood has size |N(S)| + d ≥ |N(S)| + (|S| − |N(S)|) = |S|, since S's deficiency never exceeds d. So Hall places all of X; at most d of the placements use dummies (there are only d of them); the remaining ≥ |X| − d placements are real. Delete the dummy edges. ∎ (Pattern **P11** in a new costume: *when a hypothesis fails by d, pad with d universal options and it holds*.)

Check it on the lab's E2 (three applicants: x0 and x1 both qualified only for y0; x2 qualified only for y1; and a fourth applicant x3 qualified for nothing). The worst set is S* = {x0, x1, x3}: three applicants, one position — deficiency 2. The theorem promises |X| − d = 4 − 2 = **2**, and indeed a maximum matching marries two applicants (x1–y0, x2–y1, say). The lab confirms this by brute force.

**What you now own:** the two-regime induction (P4), the deficiency form and its padding proof (P11), and the reflex of asking *how far* a theorem's hypothesis can bend before it snaps.

## Lecture 2 · A Theorem You Can Run

Hall tells you *when* everyone can be placed. This lecture's theorem tells you the exact size of the best partial placement — and its proof is a machine: run the machine, and the machine's stopping point *is* the tightness witness.

**König–Egerváry Theorem** (1931). In a bipartite graph, the maximum matching size ν equals the minimum vertex cover size τ. (A **vertex cover** is a set of vertices touching every edge.)

### 2.1 The free inequality, then the engine

First the direction that costs nothing: **τ ≥ ν.** Take a minimum cover C and any matching M. The edges of M share no vertices, so each one needs its own member of C: an injection from M-edges into C. Counting the same world two ways (P2) gives |M| ≤ |C| for *every* matching and *every* cover. Equality is the theorem — and equality is where the work is.

Now the engine (**P16 + P18**). Take any matching M — we will improve it until it cannot be improved. Call an X-vertex **free** if M leaves it unmatched. An **M-alternating path** starts at a free X-vertex and alternates edges not-in-M, in-M, not-in-M, … Let Z be everything reachable from the free X-vertices by alternating paths. Two outcomes:

- **A free Y-vertex is reachable.** Then the alternating path to it has one more non-matching edge than matching edges: flip the path (non-M edges become M-edges and vice versa). The matching grows by exactly one edge. **Augment.** Repeat.
- **No free Y-vertex is reachable.** Then M is maximum, and Z is about to pay us for the trip. Define

**C = (X ∖ Z) ∪ (Y ∩ Z)**

and claim: *C is a vertex cover with |C| = |M|.* If true, we have exhibited a cover of the matching's size — the free inequality then forces ν = τ and certifies that M was maximum. Three verifications, each a line:

*Cover.* Could an edge xy go from x ∈ X ∩ Z to y ∈ Y ∖ Z? The path reaching x ends with a matching edge or nothing — either way x can traverse the non-matching edge xy, which would put y in Z. Contradiction; so every edge either has its X-end in X ∖ Z ⊆ C, or crosses from X ∩ Z into Y ∩ Z ⊆ C and is covered by its Y-end. ✓

*Parity of the matching.* Every M-edge has exactly one end in C. Its Y-end y enters Z only via a non-matching edge; if y ∈ Z, the alternating rule immediately pulls y's partner x into Z — so y ∈ Z forces x ∈ Z. Conversely if x ∈ Z is matched, x entered Z via its matching edge from y — so x ∈ Z forces y ∈ Z. Matched pairs stand or fall **together** in Z; C keeps exactly one of each pair (X ∖ Z keeps x when both fall in Z; Y ∩ Z keeps y when both stay out). ✓

*Size.* Every C-vertex is matched: X ∖ Z contains no free vertex (free X-vertices all start in Z), and a Y-vertex of Z sits at the end of an alternating path from a free X-vertex — if it were unmatched, that path would be augmenting, and we are in the "stuck" case. Since each matched pair contributes exactly one C-vertex and matching pairs are disjoint, |C| = |M|. ✓

The machine halts (each augmentation grows |M|, which is bounded), and on halting it prints the cover C. **ν = τ, proved by an algorithm whose failure mode is the tightness certificate.** This is pattern **P18** in its purest form, and it is *constructive in both directions*: the matching you cannot improve and the cover you cannot shrink are the same information.

✎ **Checkpoint.** Run the engine by hand on E2 with M = {x1–y0, x2–y1}: the free applicants are x0 and x3; the alternating reachability set is Z = {x0, x3, y0, x1}; the certificate is C = (X ∖ Z) ∪ (Y ∩ Z) = {x2} ∪ {y0} = **{x2, y0}** — a cover of size 2 = |M|. The machine, run on three edges, just told you exactly which two vertices witness the optimum.

**A remark for later.** The set C came in a strange dress: X-vertices *outside* the reachable set, Y-vertices *inside* it. File that shape; Lecture 3 will produce the same cover by pure thought, and Lecture 4 will produce it as a *cut*. Three costumes, one theorem — that is the next lecture's whole point.

**What you now own:** alternating reachability (P16), augment-or-certify (P18), the free-inequality reflex (P2), and the shape (X∖Z) ∪ (Y∩Z).

## Lecture 3 · Three Costumes, One Theorem

Sit back from the proofs and look at what was actually proved. Three theorems that look like different subjects:

| Costume | Quantity maximized | Quantity minimized | Weak inequality |
|---------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Hall** (L1) | applicants placed ν_X | deficiency d | any deficient set blocks ≥ d placements |
| **König** (L2) | matching size ν | cover size τ | τ ≥ ν is a line |
| **Max-flow** (L4) | flow value | s–t cut capacity | value ≤ every cut's capacity |

In the König and max-flow rows the two quantities are equal; in the Hall row they *sum* — placed + deficiency = |X|, i.e. ν_X = |X| − d, which is exactly the deficiency form of L1.2 — and each row is *equivalent* to the other rows. This is pattern **P17** at full power: whenever you suspect a min–max theorem, first secure the trivial weak inequality, then hunt the alternating-path (or reachability) certificate for equality. The certificate is never far from the greedy procedure's stuck state.

Let us close the dictionary explicitly, because the translations are theorems in their own right.

### 3.1 König ⇒ Hall

Assume König. Given Hall's condition, show τ ≥ |X|: then ν ≥ |X| means a matching saturating X exists. Take any vertex cover C and let S = X ∖ C. Every edge from S must be covered by its Y-end, so N(S) ⊆ C ∩ Y: |C ∩ Y| ≥ |N(S)| ≥ |S| = |X| − |C ∩ X|. Rearranged, |C| = |C ∩ X| + |C ∩ Y| ≥ |X|. Every cover has size ≥ |X|, so ν = τ ≥ |X|: a maximum matching saturates X. ∎

### 3.2 Hall ⇒ König

Assume Hall — hence (by L1.2's padding proof, which used nothing but Hall) the deficiency form. Let d be the maximum deficiency and S* a worst set; the deficiency form gives ν = |X| − d. Now build a cover of exactly that size:

**C = (X ∖ S*) ∪ N(S*)**.

It covers every edge (edges out of S* land in N(S*); every other edge is covered by its X-end), and |C| = |X| − |S*| + |N(S*)| = |X| − d = ν. With the free inequality τ ≥ ν, this cover is minimum: τ = ν. ∎

Look at the shape of C once more: X-vertices *outside* a special set, Y-vertices *inside* its neighborhood. It is the (X∖Z) ∪ (Y∩Z) of Lecture 2 with Z replaced by S* — the same cover wearing its static (worst-set) and dynamic (reachable-set) costumes. When two proofs of one fact produce the same object by different routes, you have found the theorem's true face.

### 3.3 What the dictionary cannot do

The honest frontier. Hall and König live in bipartite graphs because alternating paths there have a rigid side-structure. In a general graph, an alternating path can wander back to its own side — an odd cycle — and the Lecture-2 *search* stalls: the parity-labeled alternating walk can report "no augmenting path" while one exists. It is worth being precise about what does and does not survive the crossing. **Berge's lemma** (all graphs): a matching M is maximum **if and only if** no M-augmenting path exists — bipartiteness plays no role. (If a larger matching M′ exists, the components of M △ M′ are alternating cycles and alternating paths; since |M′| > |M|, some path component carries one more M′-edge than M-edge — and that is an M-augmenting path.) What genuinely fails beyond bipartite graphs is the *bookkeeping*: a search that permanently labels vertices "X-side" or "Y-side" can miss an augmenting path hiding behind an odd alternating cycle, and then falsely reports failure. The repairs exist and are deep:

- **Tutte's theorem** (1947, statement): G has a perfect matching iff for every U ⊆ V, the number of odd components of G − U is at most |U|.
- **Edmonds' blossom algorithm** (1965, statement): contract odd alternating cycles ("blossoms") and the alternating-path engine works again — the first polynomial-time matching algorithm and the birth of polyhedral combinatorics.

Both are beyond this chapter's scope; the ◐ exploration at the end sends you to the exact wall the bipartite proofs lean on.

**What you now own:** the dictionary (Hall ⇄ König ⇄ max-flow), the two translation proofs, and a named reason the bipartite world is special.

---

## Lecture 4 · The Freeway Theorem

Now the third costume in full: flows. A network is a directed graph with a source s, a sink t, and a capacity c(e) ≥ 0 on each edge. A **flow** assigns each edge a value f(e) with **0 ≤ f(e) ≤ c(e)** so that at every vertex except s and t, inflow = outflow (**conservation**). Its **value** |f| is the net flow leaving s. An **s–t cut** is a partition (S, V∖S) with s ∈ S, t ∉ S; its capacity is the total capacity of edges from S to V∖S.

**Max-flow min-cut theorem.** The maximum flow value equals the minimum cut capacity.

### 4.1 The free inequality, then the engine

**Value ≤ every cut's capacity.** By conservation, the value of f equals the net flow across any s–t cut: |f| = Σ_{u∈S, v∉S} f(u,v) − Σ_{u∉S, v∈S} f(u,v) (telescope the vertex-by-vertex conservation over S — P2 again). The first sum is at most the cut's capacity; the second is at most 0 — well, it is *subtracted*, and it is ≥ 0 since f ≥ 0. So |f| ≤ c(S, V∖S). ∎ Equality for *some* flow and *some* cut simultaneously is the theorem.

The engine (P18, third appearance): push flow greedily along s–t paths that still have room, and when no path has room, the **stuck state is the minimum cut**. To say "room" properly, work in the **residual network**: for each edge u→v with capacity c and current flow f, the residual capacity forward is c − f, and — this is the twist that makes everything work — the residual capacity of the *reverse* edge v→u is f (pushing flow backward is how the algorithm *changes its mind*, rerouting earlier greedy choices). If the residual network has an s–t path, push its bottleneck amount (the minimum residual capacity along it): the flow value rises. If it has none:

**Stuck ⇒ the reachable set is a saturated cut.** Let Z be the residual-reachable vertices from s; t ∉ Z. Every edge u→v from Z to V∖Z has residual 0 (else v would be reachable): f(u,v) = c(u,v) — *saturated*. And every edge v→u from V∖Z into Z carries f(v,u) = 0: if it carried flow, the residual reverse edge u→v would have positive capacity and pull v into Z. So in the net-flow-across-the-cut formula, the first sum is the full cut capacity and the second sum vanishes: **|f| = c(Z, V∖Z)**. The stuck flow equals the cut it exposes; the free inequality says nothing beats that cut and no flow beats this one. Both are optimal. ∎

**Termination, honestly.** With *integer* capacities, each augmentation pushes at least 1 (the bottleneck is a positive integer, and residuals stay integers), and the value is bounded above by, say, the capacity of the cut {s} alone. So the engine halts after finitely many augmentations — ≤ the min-cut value of them, in fact. With arbitrary real capacities the greedy engine can chase an infinite sequence of shrinking bottlenecks and never finish (a famous four-vertex example with capacities built from the golden ratio does exactly that — a literature landmark, stated here without proof). The **Edmonds–Karp** refinement — always augment along a *shortest* residual path — terminates in polynomial time for all capacities (statement). The lab runs the greedy engine and counts its augmentations: on small networks it stops in 2–3 rounds.

**Integrality, and König falls out.** Integer capacities ⇒ the final flow is integral (it was built by integer pushes). Specialize: bipartite G, capacity 1 on every s→x and every y→t edge, capacity ∞ on every x→y edge. Integral flows ↔ matchings (each x receives ≤ 1 from s, each y ships ≤ 1 to t, so the x→y edges used form a matching; value = size). Finite cuts ↔ vertex covers: a cut of finite capacity cannot cut any ∞ edge, so for every edge xy the cut takes x (via s→x) or y (via y→t) — a cover — and conversely every cover cuts exactly its own size. Max-flow min-cut *is* König–Egerváry, and Hall follows by L3.1. The dictionary closes. ∎

✎ **Checkpoint.** The lab's network N1 is a diamond: s → a (3), s → b (2), a → b (1), a → t (2), b → t (3). Predict the min cut before running: there are four cuts to price — {s}, {s,a}, {s,b}, {s,a,b}. The lab says the value is 5; find all three cuts that achieve it.

**What you now own:** residual thinking (the right to *un-decide*), stuck-state certificates, integrality by construction, and the flow compiler — the reflex of writing a small network first whenever a matching, covering, or dispatch question appears.

## Lecture 5 · Delegates, Dispatchers, and the Flow Compiler

The machinery is built; this lecture cashes it in across three classic applications — and states honestly where the open problems begin.

### 5.1 Committees and delegates: SDR

n committees, each a subset A_i of a pool of people; each committee must send **its own** delegate, and no person delegates twice. A **system of distinct representatives** (SDR) is exactly a matching saturating the index side of the bipartite graph i ↔ (people in A_i). Hall translates verbatim:

**Theorem.** An SDR exists iff every subcollection of the committees has a union at least as large as the subcollection itself.

*Warm-up, by hand:* committees {a,b}, {b,c}, {a,c} — every pair's union has size 2 ≥ 2, the triple's union has 3 ≥ 3; an SDR exists: a, b, c respectively. *Failure, by hand:* four committees all equal to {a,b}: the full collection has union 2 < 4 — no SDR, and at most two committees can be served (L1.2's deficiency form says exactly two, d = 4 − 2).

This innocuous translation is load-bearing: **Latin squares** are built row by row out of SDRs (the ◆ exercise 13 asks you to prove it), and **Dilworth's theorem** for partially ordered sets is König in a mirror (exercise 11).

### 5.2 Schedules: k-regular bipartite graphs decompose

A round-robin tournament with 2n players needs each player to play k matches on k days without playing twice in a day — a **k-regular bipartite graph** (players vs. days? the honest model: k-regular bipartite graphs are also "every row and column of a 0-1 matrix has k ones") splits into k perfect matchings:

**Theorem.** Every k-regular bipartite graph is the disjoint union of k perfect matchings.

*Proof.* For k = 0 there is nothing to decompose, so assume k ≥ 1. A k-regular bipartite graph satisfies Hall by double counting (P2): k|S| edges leave S, each Y-vertex absorbs at most k of them, so |N(S)| ≥ |S|; and k|X| = k|Y| — divide by k ≥ 1 — gives |X| = |Y|, so Hall's matching saturates both sides — a **perfect matching**. Delete it: the remainder is (k−1)-regular. Induct on k (P4). ∎

Three lines, and every scheduling problem that reduces to "k ones per row and column" falls with it — exam timetables, round robins, parallel-processor assignment. The lab's cousin verification enumerated every k-regular bipartite graph on small sides and split each into k perfect matchings, zero failures.

### 5.3 Where the frontier begins

Two statements to carry as flags, honestly labeled:

- **Dilworth's theorem** (1950, proved in the exercise): in a finite poset, the maximum antichain equals the minimum chain cover. It is König's theorem on the "comparability split graph" — exercise 11 builds the translation.
- **Menger's theorem** (1927, exercised): the maximum number of internally vertex-disjoint s–t paths equals the minimum s–t vertex separator. It is max-flow min-cut with vertices split into in/out copies of unit capacity — exercise 9.

And one genuinely open problem, stated so you know the ground is not all paved: a full **transversal** of a Latin square — n cells, no two in one row or column, holding all n symbols — need not exist (already at order 2 both squares fail: each diagonal repeats a symbol), so the honest question is partial. The **Brualdi–Stein conjecture** — the standing form — asks whether every Latin square of order n has a *partial* transversal of size at least n − 1 (n − 1 cells in distinct rows, distinct columns, holding distinct symbols); even this is open in general. The SDR pattern you just learned is the engine of every partial result.

**The flow compiler, stated as a reflex.** When a problem says *matching, covering, dispatch, scheduling, representatives, disjoint paths* — write the small network first. Hall, König, Menger, Dilworth, and the k-regular decomposition are each one network away; the art is choosing vertices and capacities so that *conservation means what you want it to mean*.

**What you now own:** SDR as matching-in-disguise, the k-regular decomposition and its double-counting seed, the Dilworth/Menger flags, and the compiler reflex.

## The Trick Bag (reference card)

| Pattern | Plain language | Where you met it |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| **P4 Critical-set split** | Slack everywhere ⇒ greed is safe; tight set ⇒ split and recurse | L1.1, L5.2 |
| **P11 Padding** | Hypothesis fails by d ⇒ add d universal options, apply, delete | L1.2 |
| **P16 Alternating paths** | Reachability from unsaturated vertices reorganizes the graph | L2.1 |
| **P18 Augment-or-certify** | Improve until stuck; the stuck state *is* the tightness witness | L2.1, L4.1 |
| **P2 Free inequality** | Count two ways: cover ≥ matching, cut ≥ flow; equality is the theorem | L2.1, L4.1 |
| **P17 Duality dictionary** | Hall ⇄ König ⇄ max-flow; translate before you re-prove | L3 |
| **Residual thinking (lore)** | The right to un-decide: reverse edges carry "refund" capacity | L4.1 |
| **The flow compiler (lore)** | Matching/covering/dispatch question ⇒ write the network first | L4, L5 |

**Formula box:** Hall: saturating matching ⇔ |N(S)| ≥ |S| for all S. Deficiency form: max matchable = |X| − max_S(|S| − |N(S)|). König: ν = τ in bipartite graphs; corollaries α = n − ν and min edge cover = n − ν (no isolated vertices). k-regular bipartite ⇒ k disjoint perfect matchings. Max-flow = min-cut; integer capacities ⇒ integral optimum. Dilworth: max antichain = min chain cover. Menger: max internally-disjoint s–t paths = min s–t separator (s, t distinct and nonadjacent).

## Exercises (graded: ●○○ easy · ●●○ moderate · ●●● tough)

*Hints are here; worked answers are at the end of the chapter. Try first.*

**Easy — one idea, applied directly**

1. (●○○) **Hall by hand.** Check Hall's condition on the lab's E1 (x0: {y0,y1}, x1: {y0,y1,y2}, x2: {y2,y3}, x3: {y3}) — all 15 nonempty subsets — and find a matching saturating X. *Hint: L1; the three tight subsets you should find are the checkpoints.*
2. (●○○) **Committees.** Which of these have SDRs? (a) {a,b}, {b,c}, {a,c}, {a,b,c}; (b) {a,b}, {a,b}, {a,b}; (c) {a}, {a,b}, {b,c}, {c}. *Hint: L5.1 — Hall on the committee graph; find the deficient subcollection when it fails.*
3. (●○○) **Everyone knows a position is not enough.** Show that "every applicant is qualified for at least one position" does not imply Hall's condition, and find the smallest example where it fails. What is its deficiency d, and what does the deficiency form promise? *Hint: L1.2.*
4. (●○○) **The compiler, by hand.** Build the flow network for E2 (L4's reduction: source → applicants → positions → sink, all capacities 1). Run one augmentation by hand, then read the minimum cut the stuck state exposes — which vertices does it correspond to as a *cover*? *Hint: L4.1 and the ✎ checkpoint of L2.*

**Moderate — two ideas, or one tricky step**

5. (●●○) **The deficiency form.** Prove both inequalities of L1.2's theorem yourself: no matching beats |X| − d, and padding achieves it. Where exactly does the padding proof need dummies adjacent to *all* of X? *Hint: L1.2; be careful why |N′(S)| = |N(S)| + d.*
6. (●●○) **Schedules.** Prove that every k-regular bipartite graph splits into k perfect matchings, from the double-counting seed up. Where does the proof need the graph to be *bipartite*? *Hint: L5.2; the seed is k|S| ≤ k|N(S)|.*
7. (●●○) **Two König corollaries.** Prove that in a bipartite graph on n vertices: (a) the maximum independent set has size α = n − ν; (b) if no vertex is isolated, the minimum edge cover (edges covering all vertices) has size n − ν. *Hint: L2 — a cover's complement is an independent set; for (b), build an edge cover from a maximum matching and prove optimality.*
8. (●●○) **Half is not enough.** Prove: if each of n sets has size at least n/2, an SDR of size at least ⌈n/2⌉ always exists — but an SDR of size n need not. *Hint: L1.2 — the sets' sizes are integers, so round up; bound the worst deficiency by ⌊n/2⌋ for the promise, and take all sets equal for the counterexample.*
9. (●●○) **Menger from flows.** Prove the vertex version of Menger's theorem, for distinct *nonadjacent* vertices s and t: the maximum number of internally vertex-disjoint s–t paths equals the minimum number of vertices whose deletion separates s from t. (The nonadjacency is needed as stated: if s and t are adjacent, the edge st survives the deletion of every *internal* vertex, so no deletion of internal vertices can separate them.) *Hint: P18 + L4 — split each vertex v into v_in → v_out with capacity 1 (s and t get capacity ∞), and read integral flows as paths; the unit-capacity vertices are exactly what a cut must pay for.*

**Tough — several chapter ideas combined**

10. (●●●) **The dictionary, both ways, in writing.** Prove König ⇒ Hall and Hall ⇒ König as full proofs (not citations): the first via the cover-size bound of L3.1, the second via the deficiency form and the cover (X ∖ S*) ∪ N(S*) of L3.2. Then explain in one paragraph why the two covers — (X∖Z) ∪ (Y∩Z) and (X∖S*) ∪ N(S*) — are the same shape in different clothes. *Hint: L3, all of it.*
11. (●●●) **Dilworth.** (a) Warm-up: if {a, b} is a maximum antichain of a poset, show every element is comparable to a or to b. (b) Prove Dilworth's theorem via König on the **split graph**: elements x on the left, copies x⁺ on the right, an edge x → y⁺ whenever x < y. *Hint: two constructions — a maximum matching of size m links elements into n − m chains; a minimum vertex cover C yields an antichain of size ≥ n − |C| (take elements whose *neither* copy is in C). Combine with König and the trivial bound width ≤ every chain cover.*
12. (●●●) **When does the greedy freeway engine halt?** (a) Prove: with integer capacities, the augmenting-path engine terminates, in at most (min cut value) augmentations. (b) Exhibit a network and an augmentation *order* in which the engine terminates — and explain why a *bad* order could take many more rounds than a shortest-first order on the same network. *Hint: L4.1's termination analysis; for (b) the lab's diamond plus one cross edge is enough to see orders diverge.*

**Pattern unknown — you choose the tool** *No hints, no difficulty rating: diagnosing the problem is part of the problem. Worked answers still wait at the end.*

13. (◆) A **Latin rectangle** is an r × n array, each row a permutation of {1,…,n}, no symbol repeated in a column. Prove every Latin rectangle can be extended to a full Latin square.
14. (◆) A bipartite graph needs its edges partitioned into as few matchings as possible. Prove the answer is exactly Δ, the maximum degree — and find the engine inside this chapter.
15. (◆) A doubly stochastic matrix has nonnegative entries with every row and column summing to 1. Prove it is a convex combination of permutation matrices.

**Graded backfill — five more, each hint naming its pattern**

16. (●●○) **Mutilated chessboards.** (a) Prove that an 8×8 board with two diagonally opposite corners removed cannot be tiled by dominoes. (b) Prove the companion theorem: a rectangle with both sides at least 2 and even area, minus any ONE black and any ONE white square, can always be tiled. Where does (a)'s counting argument break down in (b)? *Hint: (a) is P2 — count the two colors. (b) is P18 — build a Hamiltonian cycle through every square (the snake: down one column, then weave back row by row), delete the two squares, and read dominoes off the two broken paths.*
17. (●●○) **Committees with quotas.** Each of n committees A_i must send **d_i** distinct delegates, and no person may serve two committees. Prove: an assignment exists if and only if for every subcollection I, the total demand Σ_{i∈I} d_i is at most the size of the union ∪_{i∈I} A_i. *Hint: P11 — clone each committee d_i times with identical membership; Hall (L5.1) does the rest. Count the necessity direction directly (P2).*
18. (●○○) **Greedy's guarantee.** Call a matching *maximal* when no further edge can be added to it. Prove, in ANY graph (not just bipartite): (a) every maximal matching M has at least ν/2 edges; (b) the endpoints of a maximal matching cover every edge, so they form a vertex cover of size at most 2τ. Compare with König's exact answer (L2–L3): what does greedy lose, and what does it keep? *Hint: P18 + P2 — maximality is the certificate: block the maximum matching's edges endpoint by endpoint, and ask what an uncovered edge would do to maximality.*
19. (●●●) **Uniquely matched, fragile.** Prove: if a bipartite graph has exactly one perfect matching M, then some edge of M is a bridge (its removal disconnects the graph). *Hint: P16 — first show an M-alternating cycle would produce a second matching; then orient every M-edge from X to Y and every other edge from Y to X, and find a sink of the orientation.*
20. (●○○) **Half the room, both sides.** Prove: a bipartite graph with |X| = |Y| = n in which EVERY vertex on BOTH sides has degree at least n/2 has a perfect matching. Compare with Exercise 8: why does the same threshold buy the full matching here, but only ⌈n/2⌉ delegates there? Then show the threshold is sharp: exhibit, for n = 4 and for n = 3, a graph with all degrees at least ⌈n/2⌉ − 1 and no perfect matching. *Hint: P2 — run Hall and split on |S| ≤ n/2 versus |S| > n/2; in the second case count the neighbors of a vertex OUTSIDE N(S).*

**Explorations — ◐ research-style training** *No single right answer — what you should find is described in each.*

X1. (◐) **Making the engine sweat.** Implement naive augmentation (any augmenting path) and Hopcroft–Karp (shortest paths, in phases). Build bipartite graphs on which naive takes Θ(n) augmentations where Hopcroft–Karp takes a handful of phases — chains of tightly-coupled pairs are the classic torture test. Measure both on random graphs and on your torture tests; record how augmentation counts and phase counts grow with n.

X2. (◐) **The wall the bipartite proofs lean on.** By Berge's lemma (L3.3) a nonmaximum matching *always* has an augmenting path — so in general graphs the danger is not that augmentation stops working, but that the *search* lies. Take the parity-labeled alternating search of Lecture 2 into general graphs. On the "paw" (a triangle with a pendant vertex) and on C₅ plus a pendant edge, start from specific small nonmaximum matchings and run the search: find a state where it reports "stuck — no augmenting path" although one exists. Pinpoint the odd alternating cycle that breaks the X-side/Y-side bookkeeping — you have found the need for **blossom contraction** (L3.3). Describe what the augmenting path "wants to do" on an odd cycle, why contraction is the repair, and confirm experimentally (brute force over the small graphs) that whenever a matching is not maximum, an augmenting path truly exists.

## Computational Lab (verified)

### Part 1 — Hall, matching, cover: exhaustive checks (code unchanged from the reference edition)

```python
from itertools import combinations
X = 4

def nbrs(E, S): return {y for x, y in E if x in S}

def hall_ok(E):
    for k in range(1, X + 1):
        for S in combinations(range(X), k):
            if len(nbrs(E, S)) < k: return False, S
    return True, None

def max_matching(E):                    # brute force over matchings
    best = 0
    def rec(i, used, cnt):
        nonlocal best
        if i == X: best = max(best, cnt); return
        rec(i + 1, used, cnt)          # leave x_i unmatched
        for x, y in E:
            if x == i and y not in used:
                used.add(y); rec(i + 1, used, cnt + 1); used.remove(y)
    rec(0, set(), 0)
    return best

def min_cover(E):                       # brute force over vertex subsets
    verts = list(range(8))              # x0..x3 = 0..3, y0..y3 = 4..7
    for k in range(9):
        if any(all((x in C) or (4 + y in C) for x, y in E)
               for C in combinations(verts, k)):
            return k
```

**Verified output.** E1 = {x0:{y0,y1}, x1:{y0,y1,y2}, x2:{y2,y3}, x3:{y3}}: Hall ✓ (all 15 subsets pass; the three tight ones — where |N(S)| = |S| — are {x3}, {x2,x3}, and {x0,x1,x2,x3}); maximum matching **4**; minimum cover **4** — König's equality on a saturated instance. E2 = {x0:{y0}, x1:{y0}, x2:{y1}} (x3 unqualified): Hall **fails** — the brute force returns S = {x3} first (an applicant with no positions at all), and {x0, x1} fails next (two applicants, one shared position); the worst deficiency is **2** at S = {x0, x1, x3}; maximum matching **2** = minimum cover **2**, and the deficiency form predicts |X| − d = 4 − 2 = **2** exactly. (Honest correction, recorded in the appendix: the reference edition's lab note claimed Hall "fails at S = {x0,x1}" and wrote the prediction as 3 − 1; the machine's ledger shows the first failure is the isolated applicant {x3}, the worst deficiency is 2, and the honest prediction is 4 − 2. The answer 2 was right; the bookkeeping was not.)

**What to explore:** modify `hall_ok` to return the *maximally* deficient set; count deficient sets of E2 (there are ten: eight of deficiency 1 and two of deficiency 2 — the full census is in the appendix).

### Part 2 — The flow compiler, run by hand-sized brute force

```python
def edmonds_karp(cap, s, t):
    n = len(cap)
    r = [row[:] for row in cap]
    flow, augs = 0, 0
    while True:
        parent = [-1] * n
        parent[s] = s
        q = [s]
        while q and parent[t] == -1:
            u = q.pop(0)
            for v in range(n):
                if parent[v] == -1 and r[u][v] > 0:
                    parent[v] = u
                    q.append(v)
        if parent[t] == -1:
            return flow, augs
        aug = float("inf")
        v = t
        while v != s:
            u = parent[v]
            aug = min(aug, r[u][v])
            v = u
        v = t
        while v != s:
            u = parent[v]
            r[u][v] -= aug
            r[v][u] += aug
            v = u
        flow += aug
        augs += 1

def min_cut_brute(cap, s, t):
    n = len(cap)
    best = float("inf")
    for U in range(1 << n):
        if not (U >> s & 1) or (U >> t & 1):
            continue
        c = sum(cap[u][v] for u in range(n) if U >> u & 1
                          for v in range(n) if not (U >> v & 1))
        best = min(best, c)
    return best

N1 = [[0, 3, 2, 0],      # s -> a (3), s -> b (2)
      [0, 0, 1, 2],      # a -> b (1), a -> t (2)
      [0, 0, 0, 3],      # b -> t (3)
      [0, 0, 0, 0]]
print(edmonds_karp([row[:] for row in N1], 0, 3), min_cut_brute(N1, 0, 3))

N2 = [[0] * 10 for _ in range(10)]      # E2 as a network
for i in range(1, 5):
    N2[0][i] = 1                        # s -> each applicant, cap 1
for x, y in [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 1)]:
    N2[1 + x][5 + y] = 1                # qualification edges, cap 1
for j in range(5, 9):
    N2[j][9] = 1                        # each position -> t, cap 1
print(edmonds_karp([row[:] for row in N2], 0, 9), min_cut_brute(N2, 0, 9))
```

**Verified output.** N1 (the diamond): `(5, 3) 5` — maximum flow 5, reached in 3 augmentations, and the brute force prices the minimum cut at 5 too (three of the four cuts tie at 5; only {s, b} is worse, at 6). N2 (E2 compiled to a network): `(2, 2) 2` — flow 2 in 2 augmentations, cut 2: the network says what the matching said. The integral flow on N2 uses exactly the qualification edges of a maximum matching, and the exposed cut is the saturated pair {s → x2, y0 → t}, which reads as the vertex cover {x2, y0} — the same certificate Lecture 2's engine prints, the compiler at work. (The full census behind these numbers — every network of each topology with small integer capacities, the stuck-cut saturation property, and the augmenting-path counts — is in the appendix.)

**What to explore:** run E1 through the compiler (expect flow 4 and a cut of 4); build a network where a naive longest-path-first augmentation order takes noticeably more rounds than shortest-first; then read the Edmonds–Karp bound.

### Part 3 — Hopcroft–Karp: shortest augmenting paths, in phases

Part 2's compiler pays one full search per augmenting edge — ν searches in the worst case. **Hopcroft–Karp** (1973) batches the work: each phase runs *one* BFS that layers the alternating forest by distance, then one DFS sweep commits a maximal set of vertex-disjoint *shortest* augmenting paths. Each phase strictly lengthens the shortest augmenting path, and once that length passes √V, vertex-disjointness caps how many augmentations can remain — O(√V) phases in total, the engine behind the O(E√V) bound. The lab returns (ν, phases):

```python
def hopcroft_karp(adj, nX, nY):
    """One BFS per phase layers the alternating forest; the phase's
    DFS then commits a maximal set of vertex-disjoint shortest paths."""
    matchX, matchY = [-1] * nX, [-1] * nY
    dist = [-1] * nX
    dist_nil = [-1]                      # BFS level of a free Y vertex
    def dfs(u):
        if u == -1:                      # NIL reached: a free Y vertex
            return True
        need = dist[u] + 1
        for v in adj[u]:
            w = matchY[v]
            if ((dist_nil[0] if w == -1 else dist[w]) == need
                    and dfs(w)):
                matchX[u], matchY[v] = v, u
                return True
        dist[u] = -1                     # dead end: pruned for this phase
        return False
    phases = 0
    while True:
        for x in range(nX):
            dist[x] = -1
        dist_nil[0] = -1
        queue = [x for x in range(nX) if matchX[x] == -1]
        for x in queue:
            dist[x] = 0
        qi = 0
        while qi < len(queue):
            u = queue[qi]; qi += 1
            if dist_nil[0] != -1 and dist[u] >= dist_nil[0]:
                continue                 # stop layering past the free level
            for v in adj[u]:
                w = matchY[v]
                if w == -1:
                    if dist_nil[0] == -1:
                        dist_nil[0] = dist[u] + 1
                elif dist[w] == -1:
                    dist[w] = dist[u] + 1
                    queue.append(w)
        if dist_nil[0] == -1:            # stuck: the matching is maximum
            break
        phases += 1
        for x in range(nX):
            if matchX[x] == -1:
                dfs(x)
    return sum(1 for x in matchX if x != -1), phases

E1 = [[0, 1], [0, 1, 2], [2, 3], [3]]    # the chapter's own graphs
E2 = [[0], [0], [1], []]                 # x3 qualified for nothing
print(hopcroft_karp(E1, 4, 4), hopcroft_karp(E2, 4, 2))

def seeded_bipartite(n, p, seed=1):      # Lehmer LCG: x <- 48271 x mod (2^31 - 1)
    x = seed                             # fixed seed: byte-identical reruns
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            x = 48271 * x % 2147483647
            if x / 2147483647 < p:
                adj[i].append(j)
    return adj

for n in (30, 60, 100):
    for p in (0.2, 3 / n):
        nu, phases = hopcroft_karp(seeded_bipartite(n, p), n, n)
        print(n, round(p, 4), nu, phases, round((2 * n) ** 0.5, 2))
```

**Verified output.** `(4, 1) (2, 1)` — E1 saturates all four applicants (x0–y0, x1–y1, x2–y2, x3–y3); E2 places exactly the two its structure permits (x1 and x3 stay unplaced — no algorithm can beat the graph). One phase each: the very first layered search already sees a maximal disjoint set. The seeded instances, rebuilt from the same seed on every run, so your output matches exactly: n = 30 → `(30, 3)` at p = 0.2 and `(27, 2)` at p = 0.1; n = 60 → `(60, 2)` and `(56, 5)`; n = 100 → `(100, 2)` and `(97, 4)`.

At p = 0.2 all three instances admit perfect matchings and the engine needs 2–3 phases, n notwithstanding. The sparse regime p = 3/n is the interesting one: vertices stay exposed (ν < n) and the searches dig deeper — five phases at n = 60 — yet every count sits far below both the √V ceiling (7.75, 10.95, 14.14) and the ν single-path searches a naive engine would pay. Behind these outputs stands an exhaustive check: on *all* 74,954 bipartite graphs with |X|, |Y| ≤ 4 the engine agreed with a brute-force maximum-matching DP everywhere — zero mismatches — and the phase census ran 16 graphs at zero phases (exactly the edgeless ones), 51,657 at one, 23,179 at two, and 102 at three (appendix).

**What to explore:** wire the phase counter into X1's torture chains and watch it stay flat while naive augmentation's search count climbs; then feed Part 2's networks to both engines — same maximum, and count the difference in searches.

## Answers to the Exercises

*Attempt everything first — the value is in the attempt; these pages will still be here when you return.*

**A1.** The 15 nonempty subsets of X: the singletons all pass (each x has ≥ 1 neighbor). The census — {x0} → 2, {x1} → 3, {x2} → 2, {x3} → 1, {x0,x1} → 3, {x0,x2} → 4, {x0,x3} → 3, {x1,x2} → 4, {x1,x3} → 3, {x2,x3} → 2, {x0,x1,x2} → 4, {x0,x1,x3} → 4, {x0,x2,x3} → 4, {x1,x2,x3} → 4, X → 4 — has slack everywhere except the three *tight* subsets, where |N(S)| = |S| exactly: **{x3}, {x2,x3}, and X**. Hall holds. A saturating matching: x0–y0, x1–y1, x2–y2, x3–y3. Machine check: the brute force confirms Hall, matching 4, cover 4 on E1.

**A2.** (a) Every subcollection's union is large enough — an SDR exists: delegates a, b, c, a in order (committee 4 takes a, committees 1–3 take b, c, a; check distinctness: {a,b}, {b,c}, {a,c}, {a,b,c} → a, b, c, and then the fourth needs a again — recount: assign committee 1 → a, 2 → b, 3 → c, 4 → a is a *collision*; the correct assignment is 1 → a, 2 → b, 3 → c, and 4 → any of a, b, c, but all three are taken. Wait — the subcollections: the full collection's union is {a,b,c}, size 3 < 4 — **Hall fails**; no SDR exists for (a)! The maximum deficiency is 4 − 3 = 1, so at most 3 committees can be served. (b) Union of all three is {a,b}, size 2 < 3 — fails; max served = 2 (deficiency 1). (c) Subcollections: {a} ∪ {a,b} ∪ {b,c} ∪ {c}: the full union is {a,b,c} = 3 < 4 — fails again! Careful reading rewards care here: only 3 of the 4 committees can be served, e.g. 1 → a, 2 → b, 4 → c. The honest lesson of this exercise: (a), (b), and (c) all fail, each with deficiency 1 — hand-verify with the deficiency form before trusting any "obvious" SDR. Machine check: all three compiled to bipartite graphs and brute-forced — maximum matchings 3, 2, 3 respectively, each exactly |X| − d with d = 1.

**A3.** Smallest failure: two applicants, both qualified for the same single position. X = {x0, x1}, Y = {y0}, E = {x0y0, x1y0}: every applicant is qualified for ≥ 1 position, but |N(X)| = 1 < 2 — Hall fails at S = X, deficiency d = 1; the deficiency form promises 2 − 1 = 1 placed applicant, which is exactly right. (E2's x3 is the same phenomenon wearing an isolated vertex.) Machine check: on all 512 bipartite graphs with parts 3+3, the deficiency form agrees with the brute-force maximum matching on every single one — the promise is never wrong.

**A4.** Network: s → x0..x3 (cap 1), x_i → y_j for E2's edges, y_j → t (cap 1) — the lab's convention. (The cover correspondence of L4.1 would prefer capacity ∞ — in practice anything > |X| — on the qualification edges; the *value* is unaffected either way because the source already caps each applicant at 1, but with capacity 1 a minimum cut could in principle slice a qualification edge instead of exposing a cover — a caution whenever the correspondence, not just the value, is the point.) First augmentation: s → x0 → y0 → t, pushing 1. Second: the trail s → x1 → y0 dies at the saturated y0 → t, and the residual reverse edge y0 → x0 leads nowhere new (x0 has no other outlet) — the engine instead finds s → x2 → y1 → t. Final: flow 2, 2 augmentations. The stuck state, honestly: residual reachability from s is Z = {s, x0, x1, x3, y0} — x2 is unreachable (s → x2 is saturated), and so is y1 (its only inlet x2 → y1 is saturated, and y0's reverse edges dead-end at x0). The exposed cut is the saturated pair **s → x2 and y0 → t**, capacity 1 + 1 = 2 — read as a vertex cover: **{x2, y0}**, size 2 = ν: exactly the certificate of L2's ✎ checkpoint. ({y0, y1} is also a minimum cover — but it is not the cover this particular residual network exposes.) The certificate engine of L2 and the cut engine of L4 name the same optimum.

**A5.** Upper bound: S* with |S*| − |N(S*)| = d forces ≥ d unmatched vertices in every matching (L1.2's argument verbatim). Padding: dummies z1..zd adjacent to all of X. For nonempty S: |N′(S)| = |N(S)| + d — this is where "adjacent to *all* of X" is needed: every dummy is a neighbor of every applicant, so all d dummies enter N′(S) regardless of which S we test — and then |N′(S)| ≥ |N(S)| + |S| − |N(S)| = |S| because S's deficiency is at most d. Hall holds in the padded graph; a saturating matching uses at most d dummy positions (there are only d), so ≥ |X| − d edges are real. The subtle point: the same d must dominate *every* S's deficiency at once — which is exactly why we defined d as the maximum.

**A6.** The seed: for S ⊆ X, count the edges incident to S two ways — k|S| leave S, each Y-vertex absorbs ≤ k, so |N(S)| ≥ |S| (bipartite is used here: *all* edges from S land in Y; in a general graph, edges can stay inside S and the count collapses). Regularity also forces |X| = |Y| (count all edges by the two sides and divide by k ≥ 1; the k = 0 case is the empty decomposition, nothing to prove). Hall's matching saturates X, hence all of Y: a perfect matching. Deleting it leaves (k−1)-regular; induction down to k = 0. Machine check: every k-regular bipartite graph on 3+3 (census: 6 with k = 1, 6 with k = 2, 1 with k = 3) and on 4+4 (24, 90, 24) decomposes into k perfect matchings — zero failures.

**A7.** (a) A vertex cover's complement is an independent set (an edge inside the complement would be uncovered): α = n − τ; König gives τ = ν, so α = n − ν. (b) From a maximum matching M (size ν), cover the ν matched vertices with M's own edges and each unmatched vertex with any one incident edge (no isolated vertices!): total ν + (n − 2ν) = n − ν edges — the upper bound. For the lower bound, take any edge cover F and shrink it to an inclusion-minimal one: now every component of the spanning graph (V, F) is a **star** (a single edge counts as a two-vertex star) — if a component contained a path of three edges, the middle edge's endpoints would each be covered by another of its edges and it could be dropped; if it contained a cycle, any edge could be dropped. A star forest on n vertices with c components has |F| = n − c edges, and one edge chosen from each star is a matching of size c = n − |F|. So ν ≥ n − |F|, i.e. |F| ≥ n − ν. (Bipartiteness was never used: this holds in any graph without isolated vertices.) With König available (a) stands on its own. Machine check: on all 512 (3+3) and 4096 (3+4) graphs, α = n − ν with zero violations; min edge cover = n − ν on every graph without isolated vertices, zero violations.

**A8.** Promise: set sizes are integers, so "at least n/2" forces |A_x| ≥ ⌈n/2⌉. For any nonempty S, N(S) ⊇ A_x for any x ∈ S, so |N(S)| ≥ ⌈n/2⌉ and deficiency(S) = |S| − |N(S)| ≤ |S| − ⌈n/2⌉ ≤ n − ⌈n/2⌉ = ⌊n/2⌋; the deficiency form (L1.2) then promises n − ⌊n/2⌋ = **⌈n/2⌉** committees served — for odd n the honest guarantee is (n+1)/2, not (n−1)/2. Sharpness, both parities: take all n sets identical to one fixed set of size ⌈n/2⌉ (legal: ⌈n/2⌉ ≥ n/2); the full collection's union has ⌈n/2⌉ < n elements (n ≥ 2), so at most ⌈n/2⌉ committees can be served — exactly the promise, never more. Machine check: on 3+3 graphs where every applicant has degree ≥ 2, every single one has a matching of size ≥ 2; the all-equal instances (4 sets, all {1,2}) serve exactly 2 of 4 committees and (5 sets, all {1,2,3}) exactly 3 of 5 — the bound is tight on both parities.

**A9.** Throughout, s and t are distinct and nonadjacent (as the exercise states; if st were an edge, it would survive the deletion of every internal vertex and no deletion could separate the pair). Split each vertex v into v_in → v_out, capacity 1 (for v ∉ {s,t}; give s and t capacity ∞, implemented as a large integer); each original edge u→v becomes u_out → v_in with capacity ∞. An integral flow of value k decomposes into k edge-disjoint s–t paths; each internal vertex has in-capacity 1, so the paths are internally vertex-disjoint. A cut of capacity k must cut k unit-capacity vertex-gadgets (∞ edges are unaffordable) — i.e., delete k vertices separating s from t. Max-flow min-cut equates the two. Machine check: on all 1024 graphs on 5 vertices, over all 10,240 (graph, non-adjacent pair) cases, the split-network flow equaled the brute-force minimum separator every single time.

**A10.** König ⇒ Hall: for any cover C, S = X ∖ C has N(S) ⊆ C ∩ Y (edges out of S must be covered at their Y-end), so |C| ≥ |C ∩ X| + |N(S)| ≥ |C ∩ X| + |X| − |C ∩ X| = |X|; König then forces ν ≥ |X|, a saturating matching. Hall ⇒ König: the deficiency form (Hall alone, via padding) gives ν = |X| − d; the cover C = (X ∖ S*) ∪ N(S*) has size |X| − d and covers everything. The shapes rhyme: the dynamic certificate keeps X-vertices *unreachable* from the free set and Y-vertices *reachable*; the static certificate keeps X-vertices *outside the worst deficient set* and Y-vertices *inside its neighborhood*. In both, the kept Y-side is a neighborhood and the kept X-side is a complement — and in both, |C| = ν falls out of matched pairs crossing the boundary exactly once. One theorem, two shadows.

**A11.** (a) If x were comparable to neither a nor b, then {x, a, b} would be an antichain of size 3 — wait, comparable to neither does not yet make an antichain unless a, b are incomparable — they are (it is an antichain), and x vs a and x vs b incomparable would extend it: contradiction. So every x is comparable to a or b. (b) The split graph: left = elements, right = copies, edge x → y⁺ iff x < y. From a maximum matching (size m, König's theorem applies — the split graph is bipartite): each matched edge x → y⁺ says x < y; every element has ≤ 1 matched successor and ≤ 1 matched predecessor, so the matched edges chain the elements into exactly n − m directed paths — and each path is a *chain*. So the minimum chain cover is ≤ n − m. From a minimum vertex cover C (size m, by König): let A = {x : x and x⁺ both outside C}. If x < y with x, y ∈ A, the edge x → y⁺ must be covered — but neither endpoint is in C: contradiction. So A is an antichain, and |A| ≥ n − m (each element has two copies; C's m vertices knock out at most m elements). So width ≥ n − m ≥ min chain cover ≥ width (any chain cover must have ≥ width chains — chains meet antichains at most once). All three quantities equal: Dilworth. ∎ Machine check: on all 219 labeled posets on 4 elements and all 4,231 on 5 (the known censuses, matched exactly), width = minimum chain cover = n − maximum split-graph matching, zero violations.

**A12.** (a) Integer capacities: each augmentation pushes the bottleneck — a positive integer, so ≥ 1 — and the value never exceeds the capacity of the fixed cut {s} (the sum of source-edge capacities); so at most c({s}) augmentations. (b) On the diamond plus a cross edge, an order that first saturates the middle edge a→b wastes an augmentation undoing it later; a shortest-first order never touches it. The machine record: over 1,024 diamond-topology networks (capacities 0–3) and 6,561 layered networks (capacities 0–2), the greedy engine always matched the brute-force minimum cut, never exceeding 3 and 4 augmentations respectively — but the counts per network vary with the search order, which is exactly why Edmonds–Karp *pins* the order (shortest first) to guarantee the polynomial bound.

**A13.** The tool is Hall/SDR — but seeing it is the problem. Given an r × n Latin rectangle with r < n, extend by one row. For each column j, let A_j be the set of symbols not yet used in that column: exactly n − r of them, since the column holds r distinct symbols. Each symbol occurs exactly once in each of the r rows, hence in exactly r distinct columns — so it is missing from exactly n − r columns. Hall for the columns: take any k columns and let U be the union of their missing-symbol sets. Count the pairs (chosen column, symbol it misses): each of our k columns misses exactly n − r symbols, so there are k(n − r) pairs. Every symbol of U is missed by at most n − r columns *in the entire rectangle*, so it accounts for at most n − r of these pairs: k(n − r) ≤ |U|(n − r), and since n − r > 0, **|U| ≥ k**. Hall's condition holds, so the columns can be assigned distinct missing symbols — and that assignment *is* the next row: each column receives one new symbol, and distinctness across columns makes the row a permutation. Repeat, r → r + 1, until r = n. ∎ The double count (P2) is the entire proof — no regimes, no case split; the symmetry of "each column misses n − r, each symbol is missed by n − r" is exactly what makes Hall automatic. Machine check: every Latin rectangle with n = 3 (30, of which 12 are full squares — the known count) and n = 4 (1,392, of which 576 are full squares — the known count) extends by this procedure with Hall's condition holding at every stage, zero failures.

**A14.** The engine inside is Exercise 6's k-regular decomposition — but the graph need not be regular. Make it regular by **padding (P11)**. Suppose Δ ≥ 1 (for Δ = 0 there are no edges to color). Add isolated dummy vertices to the smaller side until both sides have the same number N of vertices; every degree stays ≤ Δ. Now give each vertex v exactly Δ − d(v) unfilled **degree slots**. The two sides own equally many unfilled slots — each side has NΔ target slots, and the m real edges fill the same number on each — so pair the left slots with the right slots arbitrarily, adding one edge per pair (parallel added edges are permitted). The result is a **Δ-regular bipartite multigraph** H containing G. Exercise 6's proof runs unchanged in a multigraph: k|S| edges leave S (counted with multiplicity), each Y-vertex absorbs at most k of them, so |N(S)| ≥ |S|; and k|X| = k|Y| with k = Δ ≥ 1 gives |X| = |Y|, so Hall's matching is **perfect**. Delete it — the remainder is (Δ−1)-regular — and repeat: peeling Δ perfect matchings partitions all of H's edges, and restricting each to G's real edges partitions E(G) into exactly Δ matchings. Δ is also necessary (the Δ edges at a vertex of degree Δ need Δ distinct matchings), so the answer is exactly Δ. ∎ Machine check: the slot-pairing construction was verified directly on all 511 nonzero 3+3 and 4,095 nonzero 3+4 graphs — H comes out Δ-regular, decomposes into Δ perfect matchings, and the restriction partitions E(G): zero failures.

**A15.** Birkhoff–von Neumann. First: the support graph of a doubly stochastic matrix (rows × columns, positive entries as edges) has a perfect matching *by Hall*: if S rows had |N(S)| < |S| positive-neighbor columns, then the rows of S sum to |S| while all their positive entries live in N(S)'s columns, whose column sums total |N(S)| < |S| — impossible. So: find a permutation P with all entries positive on M; let λ be the smallest entry of M on P. If λ = 1, then M *is* P — a permutation matrix, and the decomposition is finished. Otherwise 1 − λ > 0 and M′ = (M − λP)/(1 − λ) is again doubly stochastic and has one more zero than M. Induct on the number of positive entries: eventually M′ is a permutation matrix itself. Unrolling: M = λ₁P₁ + λ₂P₂ + … with Σλᵢ = 1. Machine check: the peel run to ground on fixed 3×3 and two 4×4 instances — 3, 4, and 5 rounds respectively, weight sums exactly 1, reconstruction error at machine zero.

**A16.** *Part (a) — the obstruction.* Color the board like a chessboard; a domino covers one square of each color, so any tiling pairs every square with a differently-colored partner. The two removed corners share a color (their row and column offsets add to the same parity) — say black — so the mutilated board has 30 black squares against 32 white: the 32 white squares would need 32 distinct black partners among the 30 available. No tiling exists; the count alone is the proof (P2). *Part (b) — the companion theorem.* An m×n rectangle with m, n ≥ 2 and mn even has a Hamiltonian cycle through its squares: run down the first column, then weave back up row by row across the remaining columns (when m is even this closes directly; when m is odd, n is even — weave column by column instead). The cycle alternates colors, because the grid is bipartite. Now delete one black square b and one white square w: the cycle breaks into two paths, one from b's successor to w's predecessor, the other from w's successor to b's predecessor. b's cycle-neighbors are white and w's are black, so each path starts at one color and ends at the other — each path alternates and has EVEN length. Pair consecutive squares along each path into dominoes: a tiling exists. This is exactly where (a)'s argument breaks: the count is necessary for a tiling, and on a rectangle with one removal of each color, the snake shows the count is also sufficient — the obstruction in (a) is not "a count is close to balanced" but "the count is off by two." ∎ Machine-checked: every one-of-each-color removal tiles — all 64 cases on 4×4, 324 on 6×6, and 1,024 on 8×8, zero exceptions (and the mutilated board of (a): 30 black, 32 white, maximum matching 30 — two whites must go unpaired).

**A17.** Necessity is honest counting (P2): the subcollection I sends Σ_{i∈I} d_i distinct delegates, no person serving twice, all drawn from ∪_{i∈I} A_i. Sufficiency is the padding move (P11), run on demands instead of dummies: replace committee i by d_i identical clones, each with membership A_i. The cloned family satisfies Hall — a set of clones drawn from the committees I needs Σ_{i∈I} d_i people and sees exactly the union ∪_{i∈I} A_i, which the hypothesis covers — so (Lecture 1, in L5.1's committee costume) the clones have an SDR. Read it back: committee i's clones received d_i people, distinct because the SDR is, and no person serves two committees, because the SDR is injective. ∎ Machine-checked: for three committees over a four-person pool, all 4,096 membership patterns × all 8 demand triples in {1,2}³ — 32,768 instances — brute-force feasibility agreed with the condition on every single one. Micro-cases: A = {0,1,2}, B = {2,3}, C = {0,1,3} with demands (2,1,1) is feasible — A sends 0 and 1, B sends 2, C sends 3; but A = {0,1}, B = {0,1}, C = {2} with the same demands fails at the subcollection {A,B}: demand 3 from a two-person union, exactly as the condition records.

**A18.** (a) Let M* be a maximum matching and M a maximal one. Every edge e of M* touches an endpoint of some edge of M — otherwise M ∪ {e} is a strictly larger matching, contradicting maximality. Assign each edge of M* to one edge of M that it touches; an edge (a, b) of M receives at most two assignments, one through a and one through b, because M* has at most one edge at each vertex. So ν = |M*| ≤ 2|M| (P2's ledger, run twice). (b) If some edge had neither endpoint in M's endpoint set, it could be added to M — maximality again — so the endpoint set, of size 2|M| ≤ 2ν ≤ 2τ, covers every edge. What greedy keeps, in ANY graph, is a certified cover and a certified half-optimal matching — the same "stuck state = certificate" reflex as L2's engine (P18); what it loses, outside König's bipartite world, is exactness: on the 3-vertex path, ν = τ = 1 but the greedy cover has 2 vertices, and cases where every maximal matching is exactly half of ν exist on request (C₄: take either pair of opposite edges... wait, a maximal matching of C₄ has 2 edges = ν; take instead the path P₃, or the star K_{1,3}: any single edge is a maximal matching, size 1, while ν = 1 and τ = 1 — the cover has 2 vertices, twice optimal). ∎ Machine-checked over all 33,861 nonempty graphs on at most six vertices: every maximal matching M satisfied 2|M| ≥ ν and its endpoint set covered every edge — zero violations.

**A19.** Suppose M is the unique perfect matching. Step 1 — no M-alternating cycle: if C were one, flipping along C (replace M-edges of C by the non-M edges of C) yields a second perfect matching — vertices on C keep exactly one matched edge, vertices off C keep theirs. Step 2 — orient: direct each M-edge from X to Y, every other edge from Y to X. An M-alternating cycle is precisely a directed cycle in this orientation, so the digraph is acyclic (P16's alternating bookkeeping, re-cast as directions). An acyclic digraph has a sink — a vertex with no outgoing edge. No x ∈ X can be a sink (its M-edge points out), so the sink is some y ∈ Y; and any non-M edge at y would point out of y, so ALL of y's edges are M-edges — but y is matched to exactly one x, so y has degree 1, its only edge being its M-edge xy. Step 3 — the bridge: deleting xy isolates y, so G − xy is disconnected: an edge of the unique matching is a bridge. Uniqueness cannot survive two-edge-connectivity. ∎ Machine-checked: all 13,188 bipartite graphs with |X| = |Y| = 2, 3, 4 having exactly one perfect matching — every single one has a matching edge whose removal disconnects it, zero exceptions; and on every perfect-matching-bearing graph of those sizes, "unique perfect matching" coincided exactly with "the orientation above is acyclic."

**A20.** Hall, with the case split doing all the work. Suppose S ⊆ X witnesses a failure: |N(S)| ≤ |S| − 1 < |S|. If |S| ≤ n/2, pick s ∈ S: |N(S)| ≥ d(s) ≥ n/2 ≥ |S| — contradiction. If |S| > n/2, first note S ≠ X, since |N(X)| < n would leave some y ∈ Y with no neighbor, impossible when d(y) ≥ n/2 ≥ 1; so pick y ∈ Y ∖ N(S): all of y's ≥ n/2 neighbors lie in X ∖ S, forcing n − |S| ≥ n/2, i.e., |S| ≤ n/2 — contradiction again. Hall holds, and the perfect matching exists (P2's ledger run from both sides: once from s, once from y — Exercise 8 runs it from one side only, which is exactly why it buys only ⌈n/2⌉ delegates while the both-sides threshold buys the whole matching). Sharpness, machine-confirmed: on n = 4, the graph x₀:{y₀,y₁}, x₁:{y₂}, x₂:{y₂}, x₃:{y₃} has all degrees ≥ 1 = n/2 − 1 but S = {x₁, x₂} sees only {y₂} — maximum matching 3, no perfect matching; on n = 3, x₀:{y₀}, x₁:{y₀}, x₂:{y₁,y₂} has all degrees ≥ 1 = ⌈3/2⌉ − 1 but S = {x₀, x₁} sees only {y₀} — maximum matching 2. ∎ Machine-checked: all 7,384 bipartite graphs with |X| = |Y| = 2, 3, 4 and both-side degrees ≥ ⌈n/2⌉ have a perfect matching — zero violations.

## Revision History & Verification Notes

**Editions.** Reference edition (matching/flows/Hall reference treatment, one verified lab) → **Feynman lecture edition** (this edition): 5 lectures; all reference-edition methods preserved inside the narrative — Hall by the critical-set split and via König, König by alternating paths and via max-flow, the duality dictionary, max-flow min-cut with the augmenting-path proof, SDR via Hall — plus the deficiency form proved in full (the reference edition stated it only as an exercise), the k-regular decomposition promoted to a worked lecture, and the full Atlas exercise standard installed (tiers, ◆ pattern-unknown, ◐ Explorations, worked answers, this appendix).

**Corrections during the rewrite.** The reference edition's lab record for E2 claimed Hall "fails at S = {x0,x1}" and predicted the maximum matching as "3 − 1 = 2". The machine's honest ledger: with X = {x0,…,x3} as the code defines it, the first failing subset is {x3} (the isolated applicant), the worst deficiency is 2 (at {x0,x1,x3}), and the correct prediction is 4 − 2 = 2. The numerical answer was right; the bookkeeping was wrong; both are now corrected in the lab record. E2's full deficient-set census: eight subsets of deficiency 1 ({x0,x1}, {x0,x1,x2}, {x3}, {x0,x3}, {x1,x3}, {x2,x3}, {x0,x2,x3}, {x1,x2,x3}) and two of deficiency 2 ({x0,x1,x3} and the full set {x0,x1,x2,x3}).

**External review audit (session 28).** An independent review of this chapter's web edition flagged fifteen findings; each was machine-re-verified here before adoption, and all were incorporated. Critical: Lecture 3.3 claimed the alternating-path engine can stall at a nonmaximum matching with *no* augmenting path — false in all graphs (Berge's lemma); the lecture now teaches the true failure (the naive parity-labeled search can *falsely report* failure), and Exploration X2 was rewritten to hunt that false negative. A13 and A14, previously stopped short, were replaced with complete proofs (see Standing decisions). A4's residual narrative was corrected against a verbatim re-run of the lab's Edmonds–Karp on N2: the terminating reachable set is {s, x0, x1, x3, y0}, the exposed cut is {s → x2, y0 → t}, and the cover it names is {x2, y0}; the earlier text's Z = everything-but-t and cover {y0, y1} was wrong ({y0, y1} is minimum but is not this residual's certificate), and the lab Part 2 record's cover "{x3, y0} ∪ dummies' worth" was wrong the same way (x3 is reachable). Exercise 1 and the lab Part 1 record promised four tight subsets of E1; the honest census is three — {x3}, {x2,x3}, X (A1 already said so; hint and record now agree). Exercise 8 / A8 now state the sharp ⌈n/2⌉ guarantee, with sharpness examples on both parities. Exercise 9 / A9 / the formula box now require s, t distinct and nonadjacent, with the reason stated. A7(b) carries the clean star-forest proof of |F| ≥ n − ν (valid in any graph without isolated vertices). A15 stops when λ = 1. Lecture 1's "neither regime" paragraph is now honest (integer Hall inequalities make the two regimes exhaustive), Lecture 4 states 0 ≤ f(e) ≤ c(e) and computes the stuck cut as c(Z, V∖Z), the k-regular proof (L5.2, A6) handles k = 0 explicitly, the min–max dictionary's Hall row now reads ν_X with placed + deficiency = |X|, and the Latin-transversal research pointer states the real Brualdi–Stein question (full transversals already fail at order 2 — both squares checked). The reviewer's independent numbers — N1 (flow 5, 3 augmentations), N2 (flow 2, 2 augmentations), the 512 + 4,096 bipartite censuses with Hall holding on 247 / 3,125 — all match this appendix's recorded runs. Deferred to the backlog: the reviewer's two proposed proof figures — both installed in the next pass (see Figures below).

**Figures (session 29).** The two review figures are embedded as fenced SVG blocks at their lecture locations, per the dual-presentation convention of the earlier chapters (prose and lab code stay terminal-portable; the figures are the paginated-export pictures). Figure 1 (§2.1) draws the ✎ checkpoint's run on E2: the alternating reachability from the free applicants x0 and x3, the reachable set Z = {x0, x3, y0, x1}, and the cover C = (X∖Z) ∪ (Y∩Z) = {x2, y0} with |C| = |M| = 2. Figure 2 (§4.1) shows the residual network's signature move on a unit-capacity diamond (s→a, s→b, a→b, a→t, b→t, all capacity 1): after the greedy first push s→a→b→t, the residual network's only simple s–t path is s→b→a→t through the *reverse* edge of a→b — pushing 1 refunds a→b to 0, and the final flow 2 equals the brute-force minimum cut, while a shortest-first order never touches the middle edge (Exercise 12(b)'s lesson, drawn). Both figures' data are machine-verified; the runs are recorded in the verification record below.

**Verification record (all deterministic, exhaustive where feasible; run in-sandbox as TypeScript computations — the Python labs are the reader's runnable copies of the same logic).** Hall ⇔ saturating matching: agreement on all 512 bipartite graphs with parts 3+3 (Hall holds on 247) and all 4096 with parts 3+4 (Hall holds on 3125). Deficiency form: zero violations on both censuses. König–Egerváry: max matching = min vertex cover, zero violations on both censuses; the alternating-path certificate C = (X∖Z) ∪ (Y∩Z) verified on every graph for the algorithm's matching, and for **every** maximum matching of every 3+3 graph (cover, parity, matched-ness, size). Corollaries: α = n − ν zero violations on both censuses; min edge cover = n − ν zero violations on every graph without isolated vertices. k-regular decomposition: zero failures on every k-regular graph of the 3+3 census (6, 6, 1 for k = 1, 2, 3) and the 4+4 census (24, 90, 24); every 4+4 graph with minimum degree ≥ 2 (7,343 of them) has matching ≥ 2. Max-flow min-cut: 1,024 diamond-topology networks (capacities 0–3) and 6,561 layered networks (capacities 0–2) — Edmonds–Karp value = brute-force minimum cut, conservation, and the full stuck-cut property (crossing edges saturated, reverse-crossing edges at zero flow, exposed cut capacity = flow value) with zero violations; at most 3 and 4 augmentations respectively. Menger (vertex version, via splitting): zero violations over all 10,240 (graph, pair) cases on all 1,024 five-vertex graphs, non-adjacent pairs. Latin rectangles: every Latin rectangle with n = 3 (30, of which 12 are full squares — the known count) and n = 4 (1,392, of which 576 are full squares — the known count) extends to a Latin square by the SDR row-extension, with Hall's condition holding at every stage, zero failures. Dilworth: all 219 labeled posets on 4 elements and all 4,231 on 5 (exactly the known censuses) satisfy width = minimum chain cover = n − maximum split-graph matching, zero violations. Δ-round edge partition (A14's slot-pairing regularization): the constructed multigraph is Δ-regular and its Δ perfect matchings restrict to a partition of E(G) — zero failures on all 511 nonzero 3+3 and 4,095 nonzero 3+4 graphs; the maximum-degree covering lemma (a maximum matching saturating every Δ-degree vertex exists) also verified on the same censuses. Birkhoff–von Neumann: exact decompositions on fixed instances (3, 4, and 5 permutation matrices; weight sums exactly 1; reconstruction at machine zero). The two labs' recorded outputs derive from these runs: E1 (Hall ✓, matching 4, cover 4), E2 (first failure {x3}, worst deficiency 2 at {x0,x1,x3}, matching 2 = cover 2), N1 (flow 5, 3 augmentations, cut 5), N2 (flow 2, 2 augmentations, cut 2). Figures 1–2 (session 29): Figure 1's data is the §2.1 checkpoint run itself — free X = {x0, x3}; alternating reachability gives Z ∩ X = {x0, x1, x3} and Z ∩ Y = {y0}; the cover C = (X∖Z) ∪ (Y∩Z) = {x2, y0} is verified a vertex cover with |C| = |M| = ν = 2. Figure 2's diamond (unit capacities on s→a, s→b, a→b, a→t, b→t): the brute-force minimum cut is 2; after the greedy round s→a→b→t (value 1), an exhaustive enumeration of the residual network's simple s–t paths finds exactly one — s→b→a→t, through the reverse edge of a→b; pushing 1 along it cancels a→b (flow 1 → 0), conserves at a and b, respects every capacity, and lands at value 2 = the minimum cut; a shortest-first order (s→a→t, then s→b→t) reaches the same value with the middle edge never touched.

**Standing decisions.** The lecture text carries no inline history; revisions are recorded here. New chapters inherit the full standard from the start. Backlog: Edmonds' blossom algorithm and Tutte's theorem as a full section (the general-graph matching theory); Hopcroft–Karp analysis in full; stable marriage as an application section. The two session-28 review figures are installed as Figures 1–2 (session 29; see Figures above — Figure 2's cancellation diamond is a new verified example, recorded in the verification record). Answers A13 and A14 are complete proofs as of the session-28 audit: an earlier edition deliberately handed their final counting lines to the reader, and the review's replacements — the A13 missing-symbol double count and the A14 slot-pairing regularization — were machine-verified (the A14 construction checked on all 511 nonzero 3+3 and 4,095 nonzero 3+4 graphs, zero failures) and adopted.

**Follow-up review audit (session 32; every claim machine-verified before acting).** A second, independent review of the revised web edition confirmed the session-28 repairs and reported no new central-theorem error — and its assessment was re-verified claim by claim, with fresh machine runs, before this record was written. The eight confirmed repairs: (1) the Berge lesson — Lecture 3 teaches Berge's lemma for all graphs (nonmaximum ⇒ an augmenting path always exists) and locates the genuine failure in the parity-labeled search's bookkeeping, with X2 framed on the search lying, not on augmentation failing; (2) Exercise 1 — E1 has exactly three tight subsets ({x3}, {x2,x3}, X; machine-enumerated over all 15, zero deficient), prompt and hint in agreement; (3) the deficiency form and E2 — {x0,x1,x3} has deficiency 2 (machine census: exactly ten deficient sets — eight of deficiency 1, two of deficiency 2, the maximum at {x0,x1,x3} and X), maximum matching 4 − 2 = 2, first-failing versus maximally-deficient explicitly distinguished; (4) A4's flow certificate — reproduced exactly by an independent Edmonds–Karp implementation: flow 2 in 2 augmentations, stuck reachable set {s, x0, x1, x3, y0}, exposed cut the saturated pair s → x2 and y0 → t (value 2), read as the cover {x2, y0}; (5) Exercises 8 and 9 — the ⌈n/2⌉ guarantee machine-checked exhaustively at n = 3 (64 families) and n = 4 (14,641) with zero violations, sharpness exact on both parities (the all-equal families serve exactly ⌈n/2⌉), and vertex-Menger stated for distinct nonadjacent terminals; (6) A13 — the Latin-rectangle double count re-verified by full enumeration: n = 3 gives 30 rectangles (12 full squares), n = 4 gives 1,392 (576 full squares) — the known counts — with Hall's condition holding at every extension stage, zero failures; (7) A14 — the padding argument re-verified on all 511 nonzero 3+3 and 4,095 nonzero 3+4 bipartite graphs: the slot-pairing construction yields a Δ-regular multigraph every time, the Δ perfect matchings peel cleanly, and the restriction partitions E(G) — zero failures; (8) the flow lab — the printed results reproduce exactly (N1: flow 5 in 3 augmentations, minimum cut 5, three of the four cuts tying at 5 with {s, b} alone at 6; N2: flow 2 in 2 augmentations, cut 2), verified by a faithful in-sandbox reimplementation (the standing convention: the Python labs are the reader's runnable copies of the same logic). The review's one remaining issue — mojibake in the visible no-print banner — was **genuine** and is now repaired: a byte-level scan showed the frame's banner carrying double-encoded em dashes (â + U+0080 + U+0094, the Latin-1 ghost of bytes E2 80 94), three occurrences per web edition (the title line and two in the banner paragraph) — and not only here: the same corrupted sequences sat in every web edition's frame, and all five are now repaired with proper UTF-8 em dashes (see also the session-32 correction to the Ch. 4 record, whose session-28 audit had wrongly dismissed the identical banner finding as a viewing artifact). The banner still does not print, exactly as designed. The review's final recommendations — print to PDF and visually inspect the two SVG figures, long equations, tables, and code-block pagination, then re-extract the Python blocks from the exported PDF and compile them as the independent release gate — are user-owned steps, the last before release. Verdict adopted: no structural rewrite; the chapter is release-ready pending the PDF gate.

**Backfill (session 41).** Five graded exercises (16–20) with pattern-mapped hints were added, per the atlas-wide backfill mandate: mutilated chessboards (the two-color counting obstruction, and the Hamiltonian snake that proves one-of-each-color removals always tile); committees with quotas (the capacitated Hall theorem, proved by cloning); greedy's maximal-matching 2-approximation (valid in all graphs, where König's exactness is bipartite-only); uniquely matchable bipartite graphs (some matching edge is a bridge — alternating cycles, an orientation, and a sink); and the both-sides half-degree threshold for perfect matchings (with sharpness on both parities, and the explicit contrast with Exercise 8's one-sided bound). Worked answers A16–A20 were machine-verified before installation: the mutilated board's color census (30/32, maximum matching 30); exhaustive one-of-each-color removal tilings on 4×4 (64 cases), 6×6 (324), and 8×8 (1,024) — every one tileable; the capacitated Hall condition against brute-force feasibility on 32,768 instances (zero mismatches, plus the two micro-cases); the 2-approximation properties over all 33,861 nonempty graphs on at most six vertices (zero violations); the bridge theorem on all 13,188 bipartite graphs on 2–4 + 2 vertices with a unique perfect matching (zero exceptions), with the orientation acyclicity cross-check confirmed on every perfect-matching-bearing graph of those sizes; and the half-degree theorem on all 7,384 bipartite graphs with both-side degrees ≥ ⌈n/2⌉ (zero violations), both sharpness instances machine-confirmed (maximum matchings 3 and 2).

**Lab expansion (session 44).** A third lab part was added, per the atlas lab-expansion mandate: Hopcroft–Karp — one BFS per phase layers the alternating forest, one DFS commits a maximal set of vertex-disjoint shortest augmenting paths — run on the chapter's own E1 and E2 and on seeded larger instances (a Lehmer LCG, x ← 48271·x mod (2³¹ − 1), implemented identically in the Python lab and in the verifying TypeScript port, so the printed outputs are exactly reproducible). Every recorded number was machine-verified before installation: E1 → (4, 1) and E2 → (2, 1); the seeded instances (n = 30, 60, 100 at p = 0.2 and p = 3/n — matching sizes 30, 60, 100 and 27, 56, 97; phase counts 3, 2, 2 and 2, 5, 4 against the √V ceilings 7.75, 10.95, 14.14); and the exhaustive census — all 74,954 bipartite graphs with |X|, |Y| ≤ 4, the engine against a brute-force DP, zero mismatches, phase histogram 16 / 51,657 / 23,179 / 102 (the zero-phase graphs are exactly the 16 edgeless ones). A first TypeScript draft that blocked Y vertices per phase failed its own census — a zero-augmentation phase, caught by a phase-progress guard before any installation; the installed engine is the standard layered-forest version.
