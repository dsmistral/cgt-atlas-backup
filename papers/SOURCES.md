# Sources register - the books and papers behind the pattern survey

Added 2026-10-13 (user-directed): a durable record of every book and paper used so far for pattern finding, so the survey can be extended with new books and papers later. SOURCES.md is the register; CORPUS.md remains the authoritative seed list for gathered batches; the per-paper files and batch files are the gather record; papers/patterns/ is the accumulated pattern layer. Updated incrementally, never pruned silently.

## 1. The pattern source (the book)

The CGT Atlas - a multi-chapter combinatorics and graph theory book, the survey's raison d'etre. The 42-pattern Master Pattern Index is the Atlas's pattern layer; every P-ID in this repo refers to it. The Atlas exists as 35 chapter files plus web editions and a publishing toolkit (master copy in the cgt-atlas project; this repo backs up the survey, not the book). No other books were used for the survey: all paper metadata was web-verified from publisher/author/open-access records (see the verification-levels statements in each batch file). If future extensions use other books, they enter through this register with title, chapters used, and the patterns they exercise.

## 2. The test corpus gathered so far (papers A1-M9, chunks 0-13)

- Seed list: papers/CORPUS.md - 126 seed rows, 125 DISTINCT papers (L5 Ray-Chaudhuri-Wilson confirmed a duplicate of I3 at 12b; count 126 -> 125, flagged for the synthesis).
- Gather record: per-paper files papers/A1-*.md through papers/M9-*.md (template: metadata / flagged-sketch summary / decisive moves with P-ID tags / new-pattern candidates / full-text status / corrections log); batch files papers/BATCH-A.md through papers/BATCH-M.md (verification tables, pattern censuses, honest hypothesis-test results, lineages, verification-levels statements).
- Pattern layer: papers/patterns/ - INDEX.md + the 42 pattern dossiers in 11 family folders + candidates/ (7 CAND/WATCH dossiers).
- Batch themes: A probabilistic method, random graphs (9); B thresholds, entropy, containers (9); C enumerative counting (7); D matching, flows, greedy, algorithms (10); E coloring, list coloring, flows (11); F Ramsey theory (10); G regularity, density, removal (12); H extremal graph theory and structure (13); I algebraic and polynomial methods (12); J spectral methods (4); K shadows and compression (8); L designs, packing, codes (12 rows, 11 distinct); M modern structural and algorithmic (9).

## 3. Standing verification policy (user-directed, binding for all extensions)

1. ACCEPTED papers only: a row enters the corpus only with evidence of journal acceptance (a peer-reviewed venue with a pinned citation). Never proposals, never mere surveys.
2. Metadata web-verified; moves at flagged-sketch level from publisher/author/open-access records; zero paywalled fetches; open full text fetched only when a pattern decision needs it (the standing scope rule).
3. Corrections and honest misses logged, never silently.
4. New books or papers enter through this register first (seed rows with verification status), then gather per work style v2 (sub-chunks of about three papers, one push_files commit each, STATE.md + INDEX.md + touched dossiers updated in the same commit).

## 4. Batch N seed rows - youth-authored ACCEPTED papers (undergraduate and below)

Purpose (user-directed, 2026-10-13): the view of Atlas patterns ACCESSIBLE enough - and mostly used - at pre-doctoral levels: which patterns let high school, amateur, and undergraduate authors reach research-grade results. Gather = chunk 14 (sub-chunks N-a/N-b/N-c per work style v2); the synthesis moves to chunk 15. All 8 rows below are ACCEPTANCE-VERIFIED (2026-10-13); the expected patterns are seed hypotheses, to be honestly tested at gather.

### Candidates pending acceptance verification (not seed rows yet - the rule is binding)

- PRIMES-USA representation-theory paper (arXiv:2406.06712) - reported secondhand as published in the Journal of Algebra; acceptance not yet verified from a journal record; verify before seeding.
- Inagaki-Khovanova-Luo, "On chip-firing on undirected binary trees" (arXiv:2410.00039) - arXiv only: EXCLUDED by the accepted-papers rule unless a journal acceptance appears.
- The PRIMES STEP "Cookie Monster Problem" line (arXiv:1309.5985) - arXiv only: excluded unless acceptance is verified.

### Standing extension rule

Future books or papers append their rows here (with verification status) before gather. Entries are never removed silently; superseded or excluded entries carry dated notes.

## 5. Instructional and contest sources (user-directed, 2026-10-13)

Three new source classes open the extension phase. They feed teaching evidence and pattern-usage evidence only; none of them ever enters CORPUS.md, and the accepted-papers rule (section 3) is unchanged for paper rows. The Atlas's Feynman-style presentation method remains the standing method for any teaching aids these tracks recommend (the survey recommends; it never edits the Atlas).

### 5.1 Courseware and free instructional texts

- Track A (teaching aids): scour free instructional texts - MIT OpenCourseWare and comparable open university courses (candidates to pin at use: MIT 18.212 Algebraic Combinatorics, MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science), plus freely available texts (candidates to pin at use: Flajolet-Sedgewick "Analytic Combinatorics" author PDF, Jukna "Extremal Combinatorics" author PDF, Levin-Peres "Markov Chains and Mixing Times" author PDF, Lovasz "Combinatorial Problems and Exercises", van Lint-Wilson "A Course in Combinatorics") - for EXPLANATION aids that make existing Atlas patterns clearer to human learners (worked micro-proofs, intuition-first walkthroughs, visual scaffolds), recorded per text with title, units used, availability, and the patterns exercised.
- Track B (instructional pattern census): mine course problem sets and solution notes for pattern usage at the instructional level, using the corpus census method (pattern ID + the decisive move + honest miss), recorded as a separate instructional census - never as paper firings.
- Register rule: every text or course enters here before use, with verification status (availability and edition); entries are never removed silently.

Per-text records: papers/TEACHING.md (Track A). Entries are never removed silently; superseded entries carry dated notes.

Register note (appended 2026-10-14, chunk 28b): T2's problem-set material pinned for the Track B census - the series MIT6_042JS15_ps1 through ps12, officially hosted on MIT's Open Learning Library (the used-set URLs recorded in papers/TEACHING-CENSUS.md); the OCW course "session" PDFs identified at 28b as textbook-chapter excerpts (the readings), not problem material; ps4's official URL unpinned at 28b (third-party copies sighted and excluded per policy).

### 5.2 Contest canon (SAT excluded)

- Purpose (user-directed): pattern usage at the competition level - which Atlas patterns appear in prestigious exams and known question collections, and at what level.
- SAT EXCLUDED (2026-10-13): the SAT's mathematics is aptitude-level multiple-choice; it does not carry research-grade problem-solving patterns at the Atlas's granularity. The canon is: the Putnam competition (free archives), the IMO and its shortlists (imo-official.org), USAMO/USAJMO (MAA), the Kurschak competition (Hungary), and comparable national olympiads - free official sources only; zero paywalled fetches.
- Contest problems are NOT papers: they never enter CORPUS.md or NEXT100.md; a separate contest census records pattern usage under the same honesty rules (hypothesis -> test -> honest miss).

### 5.3 Free-access portals (paper hunting)

- For the citation-driven hunt: OpenAlex and Google Scholar (citation counts), Semantic Scholar (counts + metadata), zbMATH Open and mathnet.ru (verification), arXiv / EuDML / DOAJ and publisher open records (metadata and open full text). Policy unchanged: ACCEPTED papers only, zero paywalled fetches, full text only under the standing scope rule.

## 6. Selection rule for the next 100 papers (user-directed, 2026-10-13)

1. Half by citation mass, half by strategic target. About 50 rows are citation-driven classics: >=100 citations for pre-2010 papers, >=50 for 2010+ papers (the user may lower the bar to 50 later to widen the scope; any change is recorded with a dated note). About 50 rows are strategic targets: the silent registry (P27, P36, and the open P35), the under-used patterns (P20, P6), coverage-gap engines, and the P43+ WATCH descendants (absorption, randomized algebraic construction, flag algebras, containers, the Lovasz Local Lemma external canon).
2. ACCEPTED papers only (section 3, binding); never proposals, never mere surveys.
3. NEXT100.md deviation note: the chunk-16 scout delivers 74 seed rows (batches O-Y), not 100 - the remaining slots are deliberately held open for courseware-driven finds (5.1), contest-census finds (5.2), and future corpus needs. NEXT100.md rows have exactly CORPUS.md's seed status: unverified until gather pins them.
4. Incidents recorded honestly: on 2026-10-13 OpenAlex (shared-IP daily budget exhausted), Semantic Scholar (rate-limited) and the anonymous GitHub REST API (rate-limited) were all unavailable; NEXT100.md's citation figures are seed estimates from general knowledge, to be pinned at gather.
5. Dedupe pass (2026-10-13): all 74 rows were checked against CORPUS.md (126 rows / 125 distinct) and this register. Near-collisions EXCLUDED from NEXT100.md: A5 (Erdos-Lovasz, the LLL origin), A9 (Moser-Tardos), B7/B8 (containers origins), C1 (Polya), D3 (Edmonds paths-trees-flowers), D7 (Karp), G12 (Lovasz-Szegedy), H2 (Erdos-Gallai), H10 (Lovasz normal hypergraphs). Same-author DISTINCT continuations kept, flagged: V10 de Bruijn 1946 (after C7's 1959 paper), V15/W9 Tutte (after C3/E4), W12 Edmonds 1965 (after D3/D5), X1 Alon 1986 (after J3), V14 Shannon 1956 (before J2), W10 Seymour 1980 (after E6).
6. Pipeline convention (chunk-16 technical finding, binding for future pushes): the repo listing's blob sha is the git blob sha - SHA-1 of the header "blob <byte-length>" followed by a NUL byte, then the content; a plain-content SHA-1 does NOT match it. The open_url fetch route wraps raw text (a newline every 2,000 original characters; truncation at 32,768 chars with a 25-char marker) - unwrap() repairs it; the apparent "stray newlines" it caused during chunk 16 were wrap artifacts, not file defects.

### Dated note (28e, 2026-10-14): the census pass-2 source pins

The T2 6.042J problem-set series: the seven remaining official Open Learning Library URLs pinned at 28e (ps6-ps12; papers/TEACHING-CENSUS.md section 2 carries the URLs); ps4's official URL remains unpinned (two service-side fetch failures; third-party copies excluded per policy). The T1 18.212 problem sets 1-3 and the official solutions notes (PS1 soln I/II, PS2 soln I/II, PS3 soln) pinned at 28e, all officially hosted on ocw.mit.edu; the raw PS1 PDF fetch failed (service-side), and the solutions notes carry the PS1 census. Solution notes are in-track census material per the section-5.1 charter row.
### Dated note (29a, 2026-10-14): the contest canon register

The SOURCES 5.2 contest sources all availability-verified and registered (papers/CONTEST.md): C1 Putnam - the MAA Putnam Archive page open (maa.org/maa-putnam-archive), its per-year problems-and-solutions PDF links blocked to automated fetch (recorded honestly, not retried), the fetch route the MAA-permitted Putnam Archive at kskedlaya.org (statements verbatim with MAA permission; solutions compiled by Bhargava-Kedlaya-Ng, not labeled official per that site's own request); C2 IMO - imo-official.org problems pages + the per-year shortlist PDFs, PDF text extraction verified; C3 USAMO/USAJMO - the MAA Invitational Competitions page registered, per-year locations to pin at the USAMO gather; C4 Kurschak - the Bolyai Society page and KoMaL registered, locations to pin at the Kurschak gather. First census pass: the Putnam 2021-2025 (papers/CONTEST-CENSUS.md section 1, 22 problems).

### Dated note (29b, 2026-10-14): the IMO exam-census route inventory

The C2 IMO register extended for the exam pass (the register notes in papers/CONTEST.md carry the full text): the official shortlist PDFs are the statement route (the problems sections sit fully within every fetch window 2021-2025; the official problems pages carry inline statements only for 2024-2025, math-stripped in extraction, corroboration only; the 2021-2023 pages' problem-set PDF URLs do not surface - the 2021/2022 exam identifications came from a dated third-party compilation, web.evanchen.cc, confirmed by text-match against the official shortlist statements; no census material taken from it). The solution routes: the official UK host booklet (imo2024.uk, the complete 65th-IMO exam booklet) for 2024; no comparable official host booklet exists or fetches for the other years (2021: none found; 2022: imo2022.no blocks automated access, not retried per policy; 2023: the Chiba University collection of the official distributed documents - self-described unofficial, the kskedlaya-precedent class - fetches on the https route but its window reaches only the Problems 1-3 marking schemes; 2025: the Australian host site carries no solutions); the shortlist solutions sections are Algebra-first in all five years, placing the C-solutions beyond the fetch window. First IMO pass: the exams 2021-2025 (papers/CONTEST-CENSUS.md section 2; 30 problems mapped to their official shortlist homes, 8 census rows).

### Dated note (29c, 2026-10-14): the USAMO/USAJMO and Kurschak census route inventories

The C3 USAMO/USAJMO register extended (the full text in papers/CONTEST.md's register notes): the official MAA journal channel is paywalled and bot-blocked, excluded per policy; the routes are OPEN AUTHOR VERSIONS of the official reports - arXiv:2406.09518 (USAMO 2021) and arXiv:2406.11094 (USAJMO 2021), and the Trevino-hosted Lake Forest report drafts for 2023-2025 (draft status noted; Trevino the USAMO co-editor-in-chief since 2022) - all fetched complete; the 2022 exams DEFERRED (no compliant open route, dated note; upgradeable via Bajnok's arXiv backfill, e.g. the 63rd IMO report as arXiv:2509.19303). The C4 Kurschak register extended: the organizer's bolyai.hu files 2021-2025 fetched complete (the 2021/2022/2024/2025 preliminary-solutions status and the 2025 internal-use note recorded; the 2023 full-solutions file carries the official English statements; the KoMaL February-issue finals registered as the upgrade route; one fetch-variance note recorded honestly); Hungarian statements paraphrase-translated. First passes: papers/CONTEST-CENSUS.md section 3 (the USAMO/USAJMO census: 18 graded rows + 3 shared cross-references) and section 4 (the Kurschak census: 9 rows).

### Dated note (29d, 2026-10-14): the IMO shortlist C-section census route note

The C2 shortlist statements re-verified fresh at 29d (the official per-year shortlist PDFs, imo-official.org; the register-first rule - statements never graded from memory): all five C-sections 2021-2025 extracted complete within every fetch window (40 problems: 8/9/7/8/8 per year); the C-solutions beyond every window (the Algebra-first datum, the 29b note) - the 32 shortlist-only census rows are statement-level with routes honestly unpinned; the eight exam cross-references carry the section 2 grades (the two 2024 rows route-pinned from the official UK host booklet). All eight exam-to-shortlist mappings text-confirmed fresh. Second IMO pass: papers/CONTEST-CENSUS.md section 5 (the shortlist C-sections 2021-2025 - 40 rows; the selection-bottleneck datum 8.0 C-problems per year vs the exam canon's 1.6 per exam).
