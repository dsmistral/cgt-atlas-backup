# P2 - Double counting

- Family: 01-counting
- Atlas one-line: Count the same set two ways; equate
- Home chapters (Atlas): 1, 2, 3
- Status (through chunk 14a): Atlas-named textbook-canon pattern; in-corpus firings recorded below. Batch N 14a: N3 partial (the injective sumset identity). Batch N 14b: N4 partial (the chip-flow accounting identity) + N6 partial (staged products + the (n^2)! encoding bound). Batch V 24a: V4 partial (the Heawood bound's Euler-formula counting)
- Migration: this dossier was machine-migrated 2026-10-13 from the batch files (the gather record and source of truth); every census row and hypothesis-test note below is QUOTED, not rewritten.

## Census rows (quoted; source = papers/BATCH-*.md)

### Batch H (chunk 8)
- Fires in: H3 (the star-counting engine), H12 (cell counting), H1 partial
- Notes: H3's P2+P10 engine reappears inside H12

### Batch N, sub-chunk 14a (chunk 14)
- Fires in: N3 (partial)
- Notes: the injective sumset identity A x (kB) -> A + kB (Lemma 2.2, inherited from Nederlof et al.; <w,a> determines a) - the counting identity that launches the anticoncentration proof; the probability re-expression carries the P10 engine.

### Batch L, sub-chunk 12a (chunk 12)
- Fires in: L2 (partial)
- Notes: the incidence identity is double counting of point pairs - the arithmetic root under L2's P19 engine (mirror of the H3 engine note: the identity feeds the algebra, the algebra delivers the theorem).

### Batch N, sub-chunk 14b (chunk 14)
- Fires in: N4 (partial), N6 (partial)
- Notes: N4: Lemma 4.1's chip-flow accounting identity (chips sent to children = descendant chips + k x child fires - the same flow counted two ways) and Theorem 5.1's total-fires double-sum re-indexing. N6: the staged product decompositions (choose pairs, match, complete) and the (n^2)! encoding bound of Proposition 3.

### Batch V, sub-chunk 24a (chunk 24; extension corpus - NEXT100 seeds)
- Fires in: V4 (partial)
- Notes: the Heawood bound's Euler-formula counting - the vertex/edge/face counts combined through the Euler characteristic deliver the genus-to-colours bound (floor((7 + sqrt(1 + 48g))/2) for genus g > 0); double counting in Euler-formula clothes

## Hypothesis-test notes (quoted; source = papers/BATCH-*.md)

### Batch N, sub-chunk 14a (chunk 14)
- N3 P2 partial confirmed (UNPLANNED by seed; the seed expected the P28-family/P10/P13): the sumset injectivity (Lemma 2.2, inherited from Nederlof et al.) converts |A| into the probability identity that launches the proof.

### Batch N, sub-chunk 14b (chunk 14)
- N6 P2 partial confirmed (expected by seed as the double counting of matchings); N4 P2 partial confirmed UNPLANNED: the accounting and staged-counting faces of the freshman canon, at the middle-school level.

### Batch V, sub-chunk 24a (chunk 24)
- V4 P2 partial UNPLANNED by seed (the NEXT100 row targeted the Heawood bound and the T-batch ancestor role, not a P-ID census): the bound is a counting argument in Euler-formula clothes

## Cross-links (interdependence)

P41 is this pattern's arithmetic face in design theory (integrality of r and lambda IS double counting); the H12 cell-counting engine is P2+P10.
